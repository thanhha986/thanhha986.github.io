        <h3>PHOTOSHOOT EFFECT</h3>
        In this tutorial, we are creating a photo shoot effect with our just-released PhotoShoot jQuery plug-in. 
        With it you can convert a regular div on the page into a photo shooting stage simulating a camera-like feel.
    <p>
        Potential clients want to see who they'll be working with. They want to hire people, not stock photography. We produced a custom photo shoot to bring the people of Paterson Buchanan front and center and to underscore the firmâ€™s open and welcoming style. 
        Vivid images illustrate Paterson Buchanan's wide range of clients, as well as their commitment to the picturesque region the firm serves.
